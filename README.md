## Evaluation of Experimental Design Quality in AI Scientist for LLM based Agricultural Question Answering Generation (QAG) 

This repository contains our CS5063 group project on Evaluation of Experimental Design Quality for the AI Scientist system.

## Objective 
**To evaluate the quality of experimental design generated by AI Scientist**, focusing on four major components:
1. **Dataset Selection**
2. **Baseline model selection**
3. **Evaluation metrics**
4. **Significance tests**

These components together represent the core of a valid experimental setup. The goal is to identify **factual errors, mismatches, flaws and hallucinations** in AI generated design.

## AgriQAGCorpus

We constructed a curated corpus of **50 Agricultural QAG research papers.**
For each paper, we extracted:
- Ground-truth datasets
- Baseline models
- Evaluation metrics
- Statistical significance tests
